# Next Flashbang

Haven’t installed the script yet? No worries, this guide will walk you step by step through the entire setup process, from downloading the resource to getting it fully functional on your server. Follow each step to ensure a smooth installation.

## Installation Guide

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/next-resources/next-flashbang/releases/) of next-flashbang (script) AND the [latest release](https://github.com/next-resources/next-flashbang-item/releases/) of next-flashbang-item (model).  
2. Unpack the releases and remove the release tag so only `next-flashbang` AND `next-flashbang-item` remain.  
   Make sure you add them to your `resources.cfg` or `server.cfg` for them to auto-start.  
   IMPORTANT: Make sure these resources start **AFTER** `ox_inventory`!

   So, it should look like this:

   ```cfg
   ensure ox_inventory
   ensure next-flashbang-item
   ensure next-flashbang
   ```

   ⚠️ Disclaimer: Do not edit the resource name, unless you are willing to adapt the script to it yourself.
   Some functions, like exports, depend on a set resource name. The current name is preconfigured.

3. Navigate to the installation folder
   Here, you'll find a premade config to paste into your `ox_inventory/data/weapons.lua`.
   Premade item images are also included — drag these to `web/images`.

   `ox_inventory/data/weapons.lua` should look like this:

   ```lua copy
    -- ...weapons
    ['WEAPON_FLASHBANG'] = {
        label = 'K-J4 Flashbang',
        category = 'weapons',
        weight = 600,
        throwable = true,
        anim = { 'melee@holster', 'unholster', 200, 'melee@holster', 'holster', 600 },
    }
   ```

4. Configure to your own liking
   All files within the `config` folder are easy to modify to your needs.
   Changing the `src` folder contents is only advised if you are an experienced developer.

5. Have fun!
   The resource is now ready to use!
