# Next Kevlar

Haven’t installed the script yet? No worries, this guide will walk you step by step through the entire setup process, from downloading the resource to getting it fully functional in your server. Follow each step to ensure a smooth installation.

## Installation Guide

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/next-resources/next-kevlar/releases/)
2. Unpack the release and remove the release tag so only `next-kevlar` remains.  
   Make sure you add it to your `resources.cfg` or `server.cfg` for it to auto-start.  
   IMPORTANT: Make sure this resource starts **AFTER** `ox_inventory`!

   So, it should look like this:

   ```cfg copy
    ensure ox_inventory
    ensure next-kevlar
   ```

   ⚠️ Disclaimer: Do not edit the resource name, unless you are willing to adapt the script to it yourself.
   Some functions, like exports, depend on a set resource name. The current name is preconfigured.

3. Navigate to the installation folder
   Here, you'll find a premade config to paste into your `ox_inventory/data/items.lua`.
   Premade item images are also included — drag these to `web/images`.

   `ox_inventory/data/items.lua` should look like this:

   ```lua copy
    -- ...items
    ['heavypc'] = {
        label = 'Heavy Plate Carrier',
        description = 'Modular vest with 2 plate slots.',
        weight = 1500,
        stack = false,
        consume = 0,
        client = {
            export = 'next-kevlar.useVest'
        },
        buttons = {{
            label = "Manage Plates",
            action = function(slot)
                exports['next-kevlar']:managePlates(slot)
            end
        }}
    },

    ['lightpc'] = {
        label = 'Light Plate Carrier',
        description = 'Modular vest with a plate slot.',
        weight = 1000,
        stack = false,
        consume = 0,
        client = {
            export = 'next-kevlar.useVest'
        },
        buttons = {{
            label = "Manage Plates",
            action = function(slot)
                exports['next-kevlar']:managePlates(slot)
            end
        }}
    },

    ['lightplate'] = {
        label = 'Light Plate',
        weight = 250,
        stack = false,
        description = 'A light plate, made of Polyethylene'
    },

    ['heavyplate'] = {
        label = 'Heavy Plate',
        weight = 500,
        stack = false,
        description = 'A heavy plate, made of Ceramics'
    },

    ['brokenplate'] = {
        label = 'Broken Plate',
        weight = 500,
        stack = false,
        description = 'This plate has shattered!'
    },
   ```

4. Configure to your own liking
   All files within the `config` folder are easy to modify to your needs.
   Changing the `src` folder contents is only advised if you are an experienced developer.

5. Have fun!
   The resource is now ready to use. You can add the items to shops or give them via commands.
